# ShipSticks Ruby on Rails Challenge

## Description
Create a JSON REST-style API that processes and exposes data about company products.

## Installation
Please have docker installed to run app with a single command.
## Running the app
With docker installed, docker-compose up should be all you need to run the app.
```bash
# development
$ docker-compose up -d
```

This will launch three containers (the rails api app, mongodb instance, and the vite dev server) in the default local ports (3000, 27107 and 3036 respectively).
